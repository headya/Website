					<h2 class="major">Personal Statement</h2>
					<p> I’m a current junior at Lansing Everett high school while attending the Eaton RESA program. This portfolio is to display all my best work throughout the year. I always had a passion for art and believe it’s very important to express yourself in a creative way. I maintained a 3.5 plus GPA for multiple years in a row and have a deep passion for political science.

						<h2 class="major"> “Movie Trailer”
						</h2>
						<p>This piece was a challenge for me because I had a difficult time using black and white value to create and sad or uplifting emotion. I tried using low contrast to make the image look like a tragedy is about to be happen.

					<p> I’m very proud of this piece because at first I had no clue or idea how to go about the project. I didn't think I could create something complete crazy and different for the Lansing Community College fashion show. With a lot of research and
						pointers from my peers I created a great work of art.

							<h2 class="major"> “Shape Creation” </h2>
							<p> I never took time out to learn different effects and tools throughout photoshop and finally I decided to learn something new. I watched a Youtube tutorial to create a cool looking image for put on display. Following the tutorial wasn't
								the easiest but I got the hang of it and learned perks about photoshop.
